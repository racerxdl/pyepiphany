Epiphany E-HAL Wrapper to Python

A ctypes wrapper for E-HAL library on python. The methods are about the same that is on the lib. 
Few ones has modified like e_alloc to return e_mem_t object instead passing it as argument.

There is a working Hello World example there, the host application is in python and the epiphany code is in C.
